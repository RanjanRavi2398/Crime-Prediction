# Crime-Prediction
In this project, we will develop and evaluate the performance and the

predictive power of a model trained and tested on data collected from
using crime data.
The list of tasks below :
1) Data Preparation and Exploration
2) Splitting the dataset into Train and Test (8:2 Combinations
and use 10 â€“fold cross validation)
3) Predict the accuracy of Random Forest, NN, Navie bayes and
SVM
4) Evaluate the Classifier
